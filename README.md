All this project is a web project done by JavaScript, so you may want follow the next steps:  

- Clone the project -> `git clone https://github.com/WS-Jedp/sport-teams-frontend.git`

### Run the project
Once you have everything installd is really important to have the environment variables, in this project I use [dotenv-webpack](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-webpack), so you may want to checkout the `.example.env` first to know which environment variables do you need.  
This environment variables will help you to configured the firebase application, so it's really important as well that you create a project in [firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/).  

Once you have all these steps done, you only need to run the project, for that execute the command:  
- `npm run dev`
